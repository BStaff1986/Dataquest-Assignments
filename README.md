# Dataquest-Guided Projects

1. Predicting Bike Rentals
     In this guided project, I downloaded a dataset containing information describing public bike rentals in Chicago. Using SKLearn, linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models were created and tested to see which could predict the number of bikes rented with the greatest accuracy.
  
2. Analyzing NYC Schools
    In this guided project, I downloaded several datasets containing information about New York City schools including data such as class sizes, SAT scores, racial demographics, and even school reviews from parents, students, and teachers. Correlations were analyzed with a heatmap. Schools grouped by district with their reported safety scores averaged and then plotted onto a map with color-coordinated dots. The dots suggested some skewness to the report scores and so a bell curve of report scores was graphed and analyzed.
